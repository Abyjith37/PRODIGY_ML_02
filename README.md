Construct a K-means clustering method to classify retail store patrons according to their past purchases. 
Customer segmentation using K-means clustering. Welcome to the customer segmentation project repository! 
This study focuses on clustering retail store customers based on their purchase history using the K-means clustering technique.
Project Overview The primary goal of this project was to classify clients into distinct groups based on their shopping habits. 
Identifying these clusters allows organizations to customize marketing strategies, boost customer satisfaction, and optimize product offers.
Key Tasks and Achievements Data collection and preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned consumer purchase data to produce a structured dataset 
suitable for clustering analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to acquire insights into client purchasing patterns, detect trends, and find significant clustering features.
Feature Engineering: To capture client behavior, we extracted significant features such as total purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and product type.
K-Means Clustering Implemented the K-means clustering technique in Python and the Scikit-Learn package to divide clients into clusters.
Cluster Analysis and Interpretation: I analyzed and evaluated the clusters to better understand consumer categories, their features,
and potential business consequences.
